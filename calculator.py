"""Each function will take amount owed, interest rate, minimum payment, and total amount to be applied monthly to debt.

All should take the above, specifics below:
One function will take the amount of CCs, APR for each, and return a pay off plan (maybe snowball vs avalanche?)
One function will calculate auto loan
One function will calculate mortgage amount

All return a graph of payoff over time, with one line including only minimum payments and one line being extra payment track"""
