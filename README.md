# Finance-Calculator
Used to calculate different debt payoff plans, and forecasts for investing/retirement accounts.

Operated using a simple text-based UI. The user has the option to pick between calculating mortgages, auto loans, or credit card debt. Each option returns a graph and text results displaying how much time it would take to pay off each debt using minimum payments and how long it would take with additional payments. Each one also returns how much time and money is saved by paying more than the minimum amount.

The credit card debt calculator also returns month by month instructions on paying off each card using the snowball method.
